#### 👋 Hi! I’m Miguel Mendo, aka MrQuatrelle.
-  The computer science fields that interest me the most are distributed systems and programming
   languages.
-  I'm currently working in the AdTech world, at [Mobrand](https://mobrand.com).
-  In the meantime, I'm getting a Master's degree at IST (University of Lisbon, Portugal) in 
   Computer Science, with specializations in Distributed Systems and IT Systems Technology.
-  Since my company's in-house software is mostly written in Golang, this has become the language 
   I'm the most comfortable with, but I'm very fond of Rust's mathematical precision and overall
   language design. Whenever I have an idea for a personal project, I always find myself picking 
   Rust as my axe.

## Languages, Technologies, etc.
