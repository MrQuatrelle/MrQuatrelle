#### ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Miguel Mendo, aka MrQuatrelle.
-   Iâ€™m mainly interested in systems programming and distributed systems.
-   I'm most proficient in C nowadays... But I'm trying to fathom the power of Rust in my free time.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently getting a Master's degree at IST (University of Lisbon, Portugal) studying Computer Science, in the areas of specialization in Distributed Systems and IT Systems Technology.

## Languages, Technologies, etc.
