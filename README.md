- ðŸ‘‹ Hi! Iâ€™m Miguel Mendo, aka MrQuatrelle.
-   Iâ€™m mainly interested in "lower level coding". Currently working on some optimizations for the Linux Kernel.
-   I'm most proficient in C nowadays... But I'm trying to fathom the power of Rust in my free time.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently on the 3rd year of my Bachelors degree in Computer Science at IST (Lisbon University).

Btw, I use Arch... and (Neo)vim.
